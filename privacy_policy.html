        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Mahaban is a real-time video chat mobile application. You can meet cool and interesting people from all
                over the world, enjoy fun chats, and make new friends on our platform.</p>

        </div>
        <h4>Children</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>The Mahaban service is only available to persons 18 years or older. By agreeing to these terms of service you are stating that you are at least 18years old.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>What Does this Privacy Policy Cover?</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>This Privacy Policy covers Mahaban's treatment of Personal Information that we collect while you are
                using the App and the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that
                Mahaban does not own or control, including but not limited to third party services you access through
                Mahaban, the App or the Service, or to individuals that Mahaban does not employ or manage. As our
                Service integrates with third party sites, such as Facebook, and other sites and social networks, we
                assume that you are already aware of the privacy policies of those other sites and networks when
                using our App and/or our Service and when you allow us to interact with these sites and networks on
                your behalf.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>The Service</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>The key functionality of Mahaban is a real-time video chat mobile application where users can meet cool
                and interesting people from all over the world, enjoy fun chats, and make new friends on our
                platform. It pairs individuals (“Users”) together based on compatibility and other factors, and to
                enable individuals to chat and communicate online through various media including text, video,
                linking and accessing third party social network platforms such as but not limited to Snapchat
                (collectively, the “Service”).</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>There are three basic ways we collect information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>-</b> Information you choose to give us</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Information we get when you use our services</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Information we get from third parties</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Information You Choose to Give Us</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>By visiting and interacting with Mahaban, its App and/or its Service, you provide us with Personal
                Information which may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>-</b> Personally Identifiable Information: may include, without limitation, information
                    provided when you register to use the App and/or the Service, including your name, profile
                    picture, date of birth, phone number, phone book content, address, email address, occupation,
                    employer, gender, age, birthday, Facebook account info and friend list, and/or other social
                    network usernames and ‘likes' and preferences, friend lists and number of friends you have via
                    social networks, messages to other users of the App and the Service, use information regarding
                    your use of the Service, profile picture that you upload via the App or the Service, and browser
                    information.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> The information you choose to provide above may be shared with your contacts on our
                    service. You have total control over your profile information and you can access to modify at
                    any time. In addition, if you register to our service with your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook
                    Connect), we may store your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you give
                    us your expressed consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you
                    make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last names, email address, profile
                    picture, your friend lists and birthdays). Your Profile is available to other users of the
                    Service who are connected to you on our service. In addition, unless you opt-out (which you may
                    do so at any time in the settings of our application), your Profile is discoverable by other
                    users. You may choose to “block” any user on our platform to prevent unwanted access of your
                    Personal Information.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> You may also choose to share your mobile device’s Contacts list with us (including
                    names, numbers, emails, Facebook ID, Apple ID, etc) and we will store it on our servers to help
                    you better improve our service, e.g. connecting with friends on our service. If you do not want
                    us to store this information, you may opt-out through your account settings or notify us via
                    email. If done so, we will not be able to offer some of our features on our service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through the services. Keep in mind
                that the users you send texts, images, and any other content to can always save that content or copy
                it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to Mahaban
                as well: Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.</p>
            <p>It probably goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: When you contact Mahaban Support or
                communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Information We Get When You Use Our Services</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how
                you’ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you used one of the filter in app and the number
                of times you have used this filter. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we
                collect when you use our services:</p>
            <p>Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our services. We may collect
                information including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>-</b> How you interact with the services, such as which filters you view or the number of
                    times apply to discover.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Content created when using the service. It includes creating or uploading different
                    kinds of content to the App, including without limitation, photos, text, messages, posts, html,
                    URLs, pictures, video and other content (collectively, “User Contributed Content”), and the
                    metadata that is provided with the content. As you upload User Contributed Content you should be
                    mindful of your privacy as well as the privacy of others.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> How you communicate with other Mahaban users, such as their names, the time and date of
                    your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you
                    exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a
                    message or capture a screenshot). We allow you to share text messages, photos, screenshots,
                    videos and other forms of communications on our service with other users, and if you choose to
                    do so your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications may be stored on
                    our servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other users, we may not be
                    able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them
                    with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications on
                    our service is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that
                    you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become
                    publicly available. We are not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model,
                    operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device
                    identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, none direct display of content
                    moderation, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).</li>
                <li><b>-</b> User content e.g. photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials that you create on
                    the service may also be collected. Your photos and videos may be captured by other users on the
                    service, and those content can be stored and used by us or third party services (e.g. Facebook)
                    for content moderation and community safety monitoring purposes. You can change third party
                    sharing options in our product settings or writing to us directly.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Device Phonebook. Because Mahaban is all about communicating with friends, we may—with
                    your consent—collect information from your device’s phonebook.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Location Information. When you use our services we may collect information about your
                    location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using
                    methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other
                    sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</li>
                <li><b>-</b>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like most online services and
                    mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web
                    storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity,
                    browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact
                    with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers
                    are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser
                    cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or
                    rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more
                    about how we use cookies and your choices, please check out our Cookie Statement. To learn more
                    about how third parties use these technologies on our services, be sure to read the Analytics
                    and Advertising Services Provided by Others section of our privacy policy.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Log Information. We also collect log information when you use our website. That
                    information includes, among other things:</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Details about how you’ve used our services.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Device information, such as your web browser type and language.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Access times.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Pages viewed.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> IP address.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify
                    your device or browser.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> If you contact us by email and other means (Twitter, Facebook etc) we may keep a record
                    of your contact information and correspondence and will use these contact info and
                    correspondence if we respond to you.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Information We Collect from Third Parties</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For
                example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook—and you’re one
                of that user’s contacts—we may combine the information we collect from that user’s phonebook with
                other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other companies
                that are owned or operated by us, or any other third-party sources, and combine that with the
                information we collect through our services.</p>ss

        <h4>How We Use Information</h4>
        <div class="text">

                    information, or customizing the content we show you, including ads.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Enhance the safety and security of our products and services.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity.</li>

        <h4>How We Share Information</h4>

                further improve and optimize our service for you. We may share information about you in the
                following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>-</b> With other users. We may share the following information with other users</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Information about you, such as your username and name;</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Information about how you have interacted with the services, such as the names of users
                    you are friends with, and other information that will help users understand your connections
                    with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend
                    request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have
                    Mahaban friends in common;</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Any additional information you have consented for us to share. For example, when you
                    let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who
                    have your phone number in their device phonebook;</li>
                <li><b>-</b> With all users and the general public. We may share the following information with all
                    users as well as the general public:</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Public information like your profile pictures that you submit to Local. If a Local
                    service is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, it may be viewed by the public
                    at large.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> With our affiliates, we may share information with entities within the Mahaban family of
                    companies.</li>

                    service providers who perform services on our behalf, sellers that provide goods through our
                    services, and business partners that provide services and functionality.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if we
                    reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable law, rule, or
                    regulation;</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations;</li>

                    resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition. If Mahaban gets involved in a
                    merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion
                    of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and
                    after the transaction closes.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> In the aggregate or after de-identification. We may also share with third parties, such
                    as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to
                    identify you.</li>

        <div class="text">
            <p>The services may also contain third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations,
                or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service that’s being provided jointly with or by another
                company. By going to those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or
                third-party-branded service, you may be providing information (including personal information)
                directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for
                how those third parties collect or use your information. To the extent that you use a profile that
                may be available to others on our Service, you are solely responsible for its content and accuracy
                at all times. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party
                website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through
                our services.</p>

            <p>Finally—and this is important—you should understand that users who see the content you provide can
                always save it using any number of techniques: screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other
                image-capture technology. It’s also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be
                able to access messages forensically or find them in a device’s temporary storage. If any deletion
                of user information of our App happens, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific
                timeframe. And we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as
                required by law.</p>

        <h4>How we protect Your Information</h4>

            <p>Protecting user privacy and personal information is a top priority for us. We process your personal
                information to improve and enforce our security measures, combat spam, malware, malicious
                activities, or security risks, and to monitor and verify your identity so that unauthorized users do
                not access your account with us. Access to any user information is restricted to our employees,
                contractors, agents, and third-party service providers ONLY whom needs to know the information in
                order to provide, operate, develop, maintain, support, and optimize the our service experience and
                security. We use password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the
                confidentiality and security of all user information. Due to the inherent nature of the internet and
                related technology, we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control against
                loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Control over Your Information</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>-</b> Access and Updates. We strive to let you access and control the personal information
                    that we have about you. There are limits though to the requests we’ll accommodate. We may reject
                    a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of
                    other users or is unlawful. You can access and update your account information right in the app
                    by visiting the app’s Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal
                    information that we may have, you can put in a request here. Because your privacy is important
                    to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let
                    you access or update your personal information. You can also remove our service from your mobile
                    device or process account deletion.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect
                    information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook,
                    camera, photos, or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the
                    settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain
                    services may lose full functionality.</li>
                <li><b>-</b> Account Deletion. You can remove your data anytime you want. Account deletion can be
                    accessed within the app. Upon your request, we will temporarily disable your account to prepare
                    for removal. During this time you can cancel your deletion request and we will resume your
                    account. Upon the end of 30 days, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your
                    data from our servers. Please note, some information may remain in archived/backup copies for
                    legal purposes or required by law (for instance, some “traffic data” may be kept for one year to
                    comply with statutory data retention obligations).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others</p>

                services. These companies may collect information about how you use the services and other websites
                and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among
                other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better
                understand your online activity.</p>
            <p>Additionally, some companies may use the information they collect on our services to deliver targeted
                advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. Mahaban
                does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in
                the future, we will provide information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy
                policy.</p>

        <h4>Revisions to the Privacy Policy</h4>

            <p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let you know one way or
                another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the privacy policy that’s
